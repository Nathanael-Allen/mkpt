### Project Template Generator

#### Description

I wrote this small Node js script to help me generate a generic web page/application project template. The script run from the command line takes two arguments, the first is the name of the directory you would like to create, and the second argument is the path you would like to save the directory to.

Running the script will generate a new directory with: an index.html file with a basic html skeleton, a styles.css file with my basic css reset, and an empty main.js file.
