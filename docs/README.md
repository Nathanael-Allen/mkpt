### Project Template Generator

#### Description

I wrote this small Node js script to help me generate a generic web page/application project template. Running the script will prompt user to name the new directory, then the path where they want to save it (pressing enter without inputing a path will default to the path set in config.json).

After getting inputs the script will generate a new directory with: an index.html file with a basic html skeleton, a styles.css file with my basic css reset, and an empty main.js file.
