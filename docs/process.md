### The Goal

The goal of this project is to learn more about how to interact with the file system using Node. By the end of the this project I will have a command line script that can create a new project directory and fill it with my usual starter files, an index.html file with a basic skeleton, a styles.css file with my normal css reset, and a main.js file.

The first step was to create a new directory in the current working directory. In the future I would like to have an option to create the new directory in a default location that is not the current working directory.
